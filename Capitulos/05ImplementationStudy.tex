\section{Introduction}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{cap5:sec:introduction}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the system is designed over a logic circuitry level, it is moment to build a \ac{PCB} design responsive to the developed schematics. This process includes the PCB dimmenssions, components placement, tracks routing, silkscreens, etc. These tasks are achieved over the Altium Designer, same software described in Section \ref{cap4:sec:altiumDesigner}.

All the implementations share some common features regarding their layout designs. On the one hand, the used components will keep, whenever possible\footnote{Some components do not offer SMD packaging due to their electric properties.}, \ac{SMD} packaging. This technology gives a more reduced size and supports lower power ratings. Precissely, the \ac{SMD} package used for most of two-terminal components is the 0603 (1608 metric) size\footnote{1.6 mm x 0.8 mm (0.063 in x 0.031 in). Typical power rating for resistors are 0.1 watt.} Figure \ref{fig:cap5:smdsizes} shows a classification for two-terminal \ac{SMD} components in metrics and imperial units.

        \caption{Two-terminal SMD packages classification.}
        \label{fig:cap5:smdsizes}
\end{figure}

All the created layouts are built over two-layer boards. Two layers are enough for our purposes since they allow to place the components in a sufficiently reduced area and power planes are not required. More layers, in addition, would increase significantly the board costs. 

For the tracks routing process, some considerations are taken. Ground planes are placed to face noise reduction, this way a low impedance way is provided for the power signals. Moreover, parasitic \ac{EM} emissions are reduced. Power tracks are width enough to support the supplied current flow.

Together with the layout deployment, Altium Designer offers the chance to embbed 3D models of each component, building up eventually a whole 3D model of the complete board. This tool was employed, and 3D models were rendered, obtaining a preview of the modules on advance to their materialization.

\ac{PCB} manufacturer, PCBCART\footnote{www.pcbcart.com} will produce the \ac{PCB}s from the outputed fabrication files. Final \ac{PCB} posses a 1.6 mm thickness, and copper layers are 35 $\mu$m thick. 

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Mounting}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
Small package components, like the employed here, requires for precission tools to be mounted. Proper tweezers are helpful dealing with components. The soldering station used is a JBC AM 6000 ************REF, offering several soldering tips on the 1-4 mm diameter and useful tools as hot tweezers or desoldering accesories. Binocular loupe ************** WHATEVER ************ is essential for better precission. 

Components use to include at their datasheets guidelines about their surrounding layout, soldering tips, or mounting processes. They are reviewed and taken into account for the proccess.

The secuential mounting, and the existing firmware allow to carry through simple tests to ckeck proper functionality and detect errors. Actually, several corrections and adjustments were made during the mounting task.

{$\mu$Trans 434/868 3D model.}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Description}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

This module was developed because of the non-existance of reduced size \ac{RI}s including the MRF49XA transceiver, so, by definition, the module must posses a reduced size. Taking advantage of the included MRF24j40MA \ac{RI}, it was decided to design a \ac{PCB} module fitting the footprint of the named \ac{RI}. This way a single footprint is commont to all the included \ac{RI}s. This footprint is defined in Figure \ref{fig:cap5:mtransfootprint}.

\begin{figure}
        \centering
                \includegraphics{Imagenes/Vectorial/Todo}
        \caption{$\mu$Trans 434/868 and MRF24j40MA shared footprint.}
        \label{fig:cap5:mtransfootprint}
\end{figure}

The \ac{PCB} size must be suitable for this footprint, not exceeding its width. $\mu$Trans \ac{PCB} shape is defined as in Figure \ref{fig:cap5:mtransshape}.

\begin{figure}
        \centering
                \includegraphics{Imagenes/Vectorial/Todo}
        \caption{$\mu$Trans 434/868 \ac{PCB} shape.}
        \label{fig:cap5:mtransshape}
\end{figure}

Module pads are based vias\footnote{A via is a electrical connection between layers in a physical electronic circuit that goes through the plane of one or more adjacent layers.}, with a ******* mm rad. through hole. These holes are width enouth let the solder tip into them and solder the pads over the footprint. These pads constitute the electrical interface between the $\mu$Trans and \ac{CNGD} and suppose a low-cost and size solution.  

MRF49XA datasheet provides hints for the inclussion of the transceiver into a \ac{PCB}. It recommends to fill area underneath the transceiver with ground vias, thereby the module includes such vias. In addition, to have an easily accessible measure of the clock signal, the top layer posses a small pad that provides this signal. Minimal spacing is set to ****************** and the standard track width is *********************** . Power tracks width is set to *********** and ground planes are placed on top and botton layers. Vias through holes minimal radium are ************width. Table \ref{tab:cap5:mtranscomponents} contains the needed components for the $\mu$Trans 434/868 on both versions.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Prototype mounting and testing}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic tests to check proper functionality were made while prototyping the module.

Firstly, the modules were tested over the \ac{FCD} platform. For this, the $\mu$Trans pads were wired and connected to header prepared for the MRF49XA PICtail Plus Daughter Board. On this platform and using an multi-probe oscilloscope ********************************, \ac{SPI} communication signals and other were checked, and possible errors debbuged.

After this, and in collaboration with other MRF49XA modules, it was checked that the module properly carried out handshaking, network detection and joining, and data transmission and reception processes.

\subsection{Description}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
The \ac{CNGD} \ac{PCB} has to implement the whole design described in Section \ref{cap4:sec:cNGD} attending to expand functionality and usability, and reducing size and cost. Since this is key board of the whole system, most part of the weight ot the operation requirements relies on it. It must mainly contain the three \ac{RI}s, give support to expansion modules, include the power supply and battery room, programming system, and microcontroller. In addition, it must provide an easy access to the control modules (leds and push buttons) and easy deployment. Regading its test-bed character, the module must include some kind of anchors to fix it anywhere or incrust some feet. All these features must be achieved keeping size and cost limited, so the module become affordable and valuable. Figure \ref{fig:cap5:cngdshape} shows the \ac{PCB} shape.

\begin{figure}

        \label{fig:cap5:cngdshape}
\end{figure}

Power supply system, $\mu$USB and PGE connector are gathered together as entire interfacing slot at large edge 2 of the \ac{PCB}. \ac{RI}s are thought to be placed at the three short edges. 434 MHz \ac{RI} at edge 1, 868 MHZ \ac{RI} at edge 2 and 2.4 GHz \ac{RI} at edge 3. Figure \ref{fig:cap5:cngdfront} can give a better view of these ideas.  

The board includes four holes for the battery to be attached. Figure \ref{}***** ilustrates the way it works, for legs fix together the board and the batteries-holder. Moreover, the \ac{PCB} includes for more holes for general purpose in case of feet or fixing are required.

Headers module has been placed relying on long edges 1 and 2, Figure \ref{}****** shows it. Future expansion modules will be attached to this module through exctly equal headers on them, this way it will be possible to stack several expansion modules ones above others. The headers footprint to include in future expansion modules to fit the design is ilustrated in Figure \ref{}*************.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Prototype mounting and testing}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
When prototyping, first part to test is the right operation of the \ac{MCU}. After solderin R4, C2, the reset circuit, PGE module, and the \ac{MCU} itself, the microcontroller is brought under its first programming. For a right operation, is needed a right software configuration of the \ac{MCU} parameters, choosing the internal clock. 

Once the right programation of the \ac{MCU} is tested, the external clocks are mounted and tested by changing the software parameters. After this check, it is time for push buttons and leds, which are tested using test software described in Section \ref{cap6:sec:testBenches}. Rest of decoupling capacitors around the \ac{MCU} can be soldered.

For these already described checkings, power supply from the ICD3 is used. Next step is to mount the power supply system and, using external sources, try the right operation of the mounted modules.
 
At this point, the need of debbuging traces arises to keep on mounting the device. A serial communication interface is required, and since the used firmware already supports for RS-232 communication, the rs232SHIELD is mounted and used. To read more details about this mounting, go to Section \ref{cap5:sec:rs232shield}. Headers must be soldered on the board to use this shield.

Last, but not least, modules to try are the \ac{RI}s. One by one, they are added to the \ac{CNGD} and checked. The chosen firmware contains several radio tests for general \ac{TX}/\ac{RX}, handshaking, channel switching. The \ac{RI}s can be tested in conjunction with the equivalent \ac{RI}s at the \ac{FCD}.

This module is an expansion board or shield for the \ac{CNGD} module. The \ac{CNGD} sets the interface with the shield over the already described headers. Hence, this module must include the proper interface to fit the design. It has to incrust the footprint defined in Figure \ref{}******* to place correctly the connection headers. Adapting the board to these connections, the resulting board shape is ilustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cap5:rs232shape}.

This module is also a shield for the \ac{CNGD} module. The \ac{CNGD} sets the interface with the shield over the known expansion headers. Hence, this module must include the footprint defined in Figure \ref{}******. Both shields, rs232SHIELD and chargerSHIELD, use the shape ilustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cap5:rs232shape}.

Battery positive pole is accessible at the header on pin *******, negative pole is at pin ***********. These two pins are shorted to the circuit. Appart from this interface, the charger incrusts a terminal block to connect a external 12V source. This source must be capable to provide up to 500 mA.

Current version of the charger does not include any heat disipator. Tests showed that not heat disipator was required for the current configuration. Any change over the resistors configuration must consider the overheating possibility on ****** component. Thus a heat disipator could be needed.

Minimal track spacing is set to ******* while the tracks width is ******. Vias *******************. Table \ref{tab:cap5:chargercomponents} details the components needed for this module.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Prototype mounting and testing}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
This module required for a lot of initial debugging, it was needed the use of a breadboard to mount parts of the module in parallel to compare behaviors. It is important to notice that some currents on the circuit are up to 250 mA, existing possibilities of malfucntions that make this even higher. It was needed a external power supply with output current indicator and limitation for it. Of course, this module was not initially tested over the \ac{CNGD}, but emulating it just with batteries or a second voltage source.

First part of the chargerSHIELD to try is the ********* amplificator component, led, and surrounding components***************************. This parts constitute the comparator and with this, the comparator operation intends to be tested. Once this is checked, rest of components are soldered.

At this point, a lot of tests were carried out using different voltages and number of batteries to calibrate the system. The goal was to adjust the current over the batteries to a proper level, measure charging times and the proper operation of the notification led. RX****, R***, and R*** were finally set to their current value. Having this task was achieved, external controlled source was swaped by a commercial 12V adaptor and its proper operation was proved. 

Once the chargerSHIELD showed a proper operation it was tested over the \ac{CNGD}.

\section{Conclusions}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{cap5:sec:conclusions}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole implementation supposes a modular, versatil, functional, and flexible platform for \ac{CWSN} development. \ac{CNGD} module is the main piece, containing the essential functionalities for a \ac{WSN} node. This main part is able to host up to three \ac{RI}s, becoming the only \ac{WSN} platform together with the \ac{FCD} meeting this feature, and the only platform capable to access three different different frequency bands. In addition, the \ac{CNGD} accepts attachable modules that brings up new functionalities without requiring a new complete design. An existing, ad-hoc developed, firmware has been used to drive the platform as a design requirement. 

Since there were not commercial \ac{RI}s based on the MRF49XA transceiver presenting a suitable size, it was needed the development of ad-hoc \ac{RI}s based on this transceiver. These developed \ac{RI}s, called $\mu$Trans, operate over the 434 MHz and 868 MHz depending on the impedance matching circuitry and antenna they contain. They employ MiWi protocol and support sleep modes. The firmware employed is already prepared to fully drive these \ac{RI}s. It even includes a single MiWi stack shared by the three possible \ac{RI}s. $\mu$Trans are designed to be soldered into the \ac{CNGD} board and they accept external antennas over a coaxial connector.

Third \ac{RI}, a MRF49J40MA, consist of a commercial option that  operates over 2.4 GHz. It is also MiWi compliant, accepts sleep modes and it is supported by the named firmware. This \ac{RI} is also attached to the \ac{CNGD} by soldering and it contains a \ac{PCB} antenna.

\ac{CNGD} is controlled by a PIC32MX675F256L. A 32-bit, low-power, high performance, 100-pin microcontroller that posses a 64KB \ac{RAM} memory and 256KB flash memory. A larger flash memory pin-compatible \ac{MCU} exists in case of need. The \ac{MCU} enables a clock speed up to 80MHz, including an external 8MHz clock and a low-power 32 KHz \ac{RTCC}. The \ac{MCU} supports sleep modes and it is widely featured.

Power supply incrusted into the \ac{CNGD} has been designed to accept either 5V or 3.3V. 5V can be supplied over a $\mu$USB connector, which also serves as serial interface, or a block terminal. This voltage is lowered down into the board voltage operation, 3.3V, by a buck regulator. 3.3V supply option is thought for portability chances, being possible to use an included 3.6V NiMH battery for the board. In addition, it is possible to control, from the \ac{MCU}, the \ac{RI}s power supply. 

\ac{CNGD} offer functionality expansions by use of a pair of 20-pin headers. These headers enable access to general use peripherals and unused pins at the \ac{MCU} for future needed implementations. The board contains three \ac{LED}s and two push buttons appart from the reset push button. These components allow interacting with the application.

It has been also developed an attachable shied for the \ac{CNGD} that enables serial communication over an RS-232 protocol accessing an \ac{UART} available at the header. This serial interface has an easier internal operation that the \ac{USB} option and it is useful for old machines or during the platform developing.
 
A charger shield was also developed in order to get the batteries easily charged through the headers. This charger automatically shut-down the charge current at the batteries when the full charge is detected. It also contains a led that indicates when the battery is full. Current used to charge the battery is fixed and it is set to 200 mA. The charger is prepared to charge batteries from 1V to 5V.
