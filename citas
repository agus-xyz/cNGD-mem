Why don't you play the game ?
Why don't you play the game ? - Digital Love

Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face - face to face

Television rules the nation -  television


Surf it, scroll it, pause it, click it,
Cross it, crack it, switch - update it
Name it, rate it, tune it, print it,
Scan it, send it, fax - rename it
Touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it,
Turn it, leave it, start - format it. - technologic


There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
I am lost I can't even remember my name

[Hook]
I've been, for sometime,
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

[Verse 2]
There are so many things
That I don't understand
There's a world within me
That I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore
But the doors look the same
(where are the locks to try the key)
I am lost I can't even remember my name	- within
