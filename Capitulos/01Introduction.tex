\section{Background}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{cap1:sec:background}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

A \ac{WSN} consists of a number of sensors spread across a geographical area. Each sensor has wireless communication capability and some level of intelligence for signal processing and data networking. \ac{WSN}s provide a decentralized technological solution to address applications related to security and surveillance, industrial control, infrastructure maintenance, automatic environmental monitoring, domotics, localization, and tracking or health. They have recently emerged as a premier research topic due to their great long-term economic potential and ability to transform our lives.

Together with this significant growth in the last years, it was a huge and yet increasing wireless networks and sevices deployment caused by the growth in the ``Internet of Things'' connectivity phenomenon\cite{internetofthings}. Wireless communications, specially due to wireless \ac{M2M} connections, is currently one of the hottest and fastest growing segments of electronics. 

The increasing demand for wireless communication, in addition to an inefficient assignment of the spectrum\cite{wpanIssues}, has caused saturation on certains bands of the radio spectrum. Some of the most heavily used bands are \ac{ISM} bands which are unlincesed, free of cost frequencies. Most \ac{WSN} solutions operate over these \ac{ISM} bands, like the 2.4 GHz band, also used by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or IEEE 802.15.4 devices. \ac{ISM} bands are defined by region by the \ac{ITU} and local goverments ultimately. Figure \ref{fig:cap1:ituregions} illustrates the different defined regions and Figure \ref{fig:cap1:spectrum} gives a general view of the spectrum and \ac{ISM} bands over region 1.

Spectrum saturation is reflected over the increasing \ac{RF} interferences and other undesirable effects like noise, with a consistent impact over the \ac{TX} power required, \ac{QOS}, etc. Nowadays, techniques focused on expanding spectrum efficiency over communications, such as those related to modulation, power control or link adaptation, seem exhausted, and new long-term solutions are required. 

To address this challenge, new techniques such as \ac{CR} arise. \ac{CR} was introduced by Mitola in 1999 \cite{mitola1}
and 2000\cite{mitola2}. It integrates into communication networks concepts such as spectrum sensing, self-learning, self-management, 
or context analysis. Basically, \ac{CR} enables opportunistic access to the spectrum through cooperation and context
awareness. Spectrum sensing capabilities and cooperation among devices allow for better spectrum utilization and \ac{QOS}.
The concept of \ac{CN} describes a \ac{WN} aware of its environment and able to adapt its communication parameters in order to achieve more reliable and efficient communications.

\ac{WSN}s, among other technologies, maintain a high demand for cognitive networking. Their imposed power consumption constraints and hard operation conditions require an efficient operation mode, especially for their wireless communications, since these normally constitute the most energy-consumming task. However, there are also challenges to face\cite{challenges}, such as an adaptive and \ac{QOS}-aware routing, or the distribution of control data.

Despite the potential of \ac{CWSN}\cite{cwsn}, they are not deeply explored yet. Real or simulated scenarios scarcely exist, but 
realistic platforms are crucial to the improvement and development of this new field. The shortage and undevelopment of \ac{CWSN} devices
or test-beds contributes to the scarcity of results in this area. 

One of the current \ac{CWSN} node platforms is the \ac{FCD}, developed in 2011\cite{fcd} by researchers at the laboratory where this project is framed, the \ac{LSI}. The \ac{LSI} belongs to the \ac{DIE} within the \ac{ETSIT} at \ac{UPM}. This laboratory hosts researching lines related to embedded systems, \ac{WSN}s, \ac{CWSN}s, or security. The implemented device become the first real generic platform to study \ac{CWSN}s hosting three radio transceivers, but it was just a initial approach. The \ac{FCD} was still far from being a very valuable researching test-bed platform. This platform did not fully satisfy requirements in terms of low power consumption, functionality, cost and size, and communication capabilities. 

Continuing with the development of the \ac{FCD}, some software implementations were carried out at \ac{LSI}. A combined protocol stack for
three different transceivers \cite{juanpfc}, including a \ac{HAL}, was created. This firmware offers ease of use to the researchers facing communication tasks. It also supposes memory and resources savings compared with the previous scheme, based on three protocol stacks. In order to deal with cognitive strategies and algorithmics, in addition, a software module that runs over the firmware was launched. This module, called \ac{CRMODULE}\cite{guillepfc} implements the theoretical model described in \cite{conbrok} and is a crucial achievement for \ac{CWSN} development.  

This dissertation describes the development and operation of the \ac{CNGD}, a platform for \ac{CWSN} development. It includes features and capabilities not found on current devices. \ac{CNGD} must enable and promote \ac{CWSN}s, allowing test strategies and better investigation deployments.

\section{Goals}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\label{cap1:sec:goals}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

The main goal of the project is to design and implement a node for a \ac{CWSN}. The implementation must meet strong efficiency, functionality, modularity and scalability requirements. A demo application layer, also to be developed, must work integrated with the already implemented firmware. 

\ac{CWSN} nodes are very limited devices in terms of memory, computational power, or energy consumption. This fact is crucial and it must be taken into account in order to make the device valuable and affordable for researching purposes. 

The design must be modular, so it will not need to be entirely redone  with every particular change, and adaptable, to allow flexibility in the complexity and character of applications. On the other hand, as a development platform, the software and hardware architecture must provide advantages when implementing cognitive strategies as a valuable tool (data extraction, data reliability, portability, versatility, etc.). 

Hence, it is needed to reach a complete solution covering all these features.

It is important to make clear that the design must fill the gaps and deficiencies that current devices show, for example, providing a wider radio access, powering control options, or real \ac{WSN} features. Furthermore, a definition of new needs, together with an important review of the \ac{FCD}, are needed. 

Here, the main goal is fragmented into shorter subgoals:

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Analysis of previous conclusions and results}.
Study of already tested aspects. Definition of new tests to provide new data of interest. These data will help in making decisions about transceivers, microcontrollers, power supply, etc.

\item \emph{Requirements definition}. Study of needs and constraints 
(cost, resources, size, consumption, etc.) according to the future running applications.
Definition of features and requirements. Definition of the demo application.

\item \emph{Hardware design}. Global design of the platform and new envolved. Development of schematics. Design optimization.
Components selection and final layout deployment. 

\item \emph{Hardware debugging and implementation}.
Component disposition and soldering. PCB design validation.

\item \emph{Application layer development}.
Full adaptation of the firmware to the hardware.
Development of the demo application layer that uses the firmware and
allows a full test of the platform. The demo will be a
typical \ac{WSN} application.

\item \emph{General purpose tests}. 
Tests oriented to prove the proper operation and verify
the achievement of the requirements and constraints compliance.

\item \emph{Results analysis and conclusions}.
Evaluation of capabilities. Study of weaknesses or 
possible improvements. Definition of further studies.

\end{itemize}
