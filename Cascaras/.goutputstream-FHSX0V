\chapter{Abstract}
\cabeceraEspecial{Abstract}

The noise pollution generated by the human activity in the sea produces harmful effects on the marine fauna in a physical, physiological and behavioural way. The Laboratory of Applied Bio-Acoustics (LAB) at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) joining the LIDO project, works on the development of tools to control and mitigate these effects. It employs Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) techniques for the detection, classification and location of acoustic sources. In order to obtain information about marine environment using hydrophones, the LAB is planning to use an autonomous buoy network capable of sending data through intermediate buoys till a base station.

This project, included inside the LIDO project, aims to design and implement a first prototype of a multihop network specially designed to operate in the sea. This design is orientated to hold up an alarm (delivery) sending service focused on detecting the presence of cetaceans in an specific area; to pursue a system'{}s operativity reaching distances of several kilometers between buoys and to have a low power consumption.

To achieve this aim several tasks were made: Performed a technological study in order to select the appropriate equipment. Definition of the system'{}s architecture in order to insert the new modules with the one'{}s already made by LAB. Elaboration of a theoretical study of a radioelectrical link in marine environment and comparing the results with empirical measures made by the acquired equipment in the same conditions. Implementation and simulation of the necessary software for the alarm delivery management to the collector node.

The principles of this project have been: Coherence and balance for a sustainable development of the marine environment. The compromise to bring (buenas practicas) through the study, investigation and innovation of the control tools; and to mitigate the environmental impact. To follow the current radioelectric spectrum legislation.

This integrated implementation of this (Plan de Accion) has led into an data ad hoc network prototype which will be used as a tool in order to continue working. The Network operates at 868 MHz. In the test range at the sea surface for a single link we have achieved a good perfomance in a range of 2 km. It
